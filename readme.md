## Development

> :warning: Support of WIndows is experimental, and is being worked on. If you encounter any bug, please
> report at issues page.

For development, our gradle script has setup to run Spigot in `run/` directory. First time loading the
project could take a while because it's building Spigot from source, and using it as library. It's
completely normal.

### Run Server
Run the `runServer` task, it's gonna run the server located in `run/` directory

### Reload Plugin
You don't need to copy the plugin everytime you build, simply run the `reloadPlugin` task, and it will
reload the server automatically for you.

### Updating Readme
In order to have table of contents, you don't want to update `readme.md`, but `readme.raw.md` instead.
After that, you run the `generateReadMe` task, and it will generate a `readme.md` based on `readme.raw.md`
